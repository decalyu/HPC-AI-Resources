# 🚀 Workshop 1: Intro to AI & Jupyter (Make AI Feel Real!)

## 🎯 Goal  
Get students **excited about AI** before touching code. This session introduces AI concepts, showcases fun demos, and sets up Jupyter Notebooks for hands-on learning.

---

## 📌 What Students Will Learn  
✅ What AI is and where we see it daily  
✅ Fun AI demos (ChatGPT, DALL·E, Teachable Machine)  
✅ Basics of Jupyter Notebooks (in Google Colab—no setup needed!)  
✅ Intro to Python: Print messages, basic math

## 📖 1. What is AI?  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables machines to **learn, reason, and make decisions** like humans. We use AI daily in:  

- **Voice assistants:** Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant  
- **AI-generated art & text:** DALL·E, ChatGPT  
- **Face recognition & filters:** Snapchat, Instagram  
- **Recommendation systems:** YouTube, Netflix, Spotify  

🤔 **Discussion:** Can you think of AI in your daily life?

## 🎬 2. Fun AI Demos  
Show students **real AI applications** before coding!  

### 🔹 **ChatGPT (Text AI)**
- Ask: *"Write a funny story about a robot in school."*  
- Discuss: *Why does AI sometimes give weird answers?*  

### 🔹 **DALL·E (Image AI)**
- Generate an image from text: *"A futuristic high school classroom with AI-powered robots."*  

### 🔹 **Teachable Machine (Zero-Code AI!)**
- [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) lets students train an AI **without coding**!  
- Train AI to recognize **hand gestures** (✋✊✌️).

## 💻 3. Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks  
### 🔹 What is Jupyter Notebook?  
A **simple online tool** to write and run Python code interactively.  

### 🔹 Open Google Colab (No Installation Needed!)  
1️⃣ Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (opens in a new tab)  
2️⃣ Click **New Notebook**  
3️⃣ Delete the first empty cell  

📌 **Explain:** Jupyter notebooks are used by AI engineers and researchers!  

---

## 🐍 4. Writing Your First Python Code  
### 🔹 Print a message  
```python
print("Hello AI!")
```

### 🔹 Do basic math  
```python
a = 10  
b = 5  
sum = a + b  
print("The sum is:", sum)
```

### 🔹 Ask AI a question (Basic Input)  
```python
name = input("What's your name? ")  
print("Nice to meet you, " + name + "!")
```

🚀 **Challenge:** Try changing the numbers and message.

---

## 🎨 5. Hands-on AI Activity (Zero Code)  
### 🔹 Train AI to Recognize Hand Gestures (Teachable Machine)  
1️⃣ Go to [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) (opens in a new tab)  
2️⃣ Click **Image Project** → **Standard Image Model**  
3️⃣ Record three hand gestures (✋✊✌️)  
4️⃣ Click **Train Model** → **Preview**

🔍 **What happens?** AI recognizes your hand movements without writing any code!

---

## 🔥 6. Wrap-Up & Next Steps  
### ✅ What We Learned
✔ AI is everywhere!  
✔ AI can generate text and images (ChatGPT, DALL·E)  
✔ Jupyter Notebooks help us write AI code easily  
✔ Python can print, do math, and take user input

### 🚀 Next Workshop: Data Exploration & Management!  
We'll explore real AI datasets and create colorful charts with Python!

### 📝 Homework (Optional)
1️⃣ Explore ChatGPT: Ask it fun questions.  
2️⃣ Try DALL·E: Generate an AI image and share it.  
3️⃣ Modify Python Code: Change numbers/messages and see what happens.
