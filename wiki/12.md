🚀 Workshop 1: Unlocking AI Magic with Jupyter (Your First Step Into the Future!)
=================================================================================

🎯 Goal
-------

In this session, you’ll discover the magic of AI! We’ll introduce you to fun AI demos, teach you the basics of Python programming, and get hands-on with Jupyter Notebooks—all without needing any setup or experience.

📌 What You Will Learn
----------------------

*   AI and its cool uses in your life
    
*   Fun AI demos (like ChatGPT and DALL·E)
    
*   The basics of Jupyter Notebooks (with step-by-step instructions)
    
*   Python programming: Print messages, do math, and interact with your code
    

📖 1. What is AI?
-----------------

AI is when machines learn and think like humans. You probably see AI all around you every day! Here are some examples:

*   Voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant
    
*   AI-generated text and art from ChatGPT and DALL·E
    
*   Filters on apps like Snapchat and Instagram
    
*   Recommendations for movies, songs, and videos on platforms like YouTube, Netflix, and Spotify
    

### 🤔 Quick Question for You:

Can you think of other places you see AI in your life? Write it down!

🎬 2. Fun AI Demos
------------------

Now that we know what AI is, let’s see some real-world examples in action. These demos show how fun and powerful AI can be! You don’t need to write any code for these. Just watch and enjoy!

### 🔹 ChatGPT (AI that writes text)

*   **Type:** "Write a funny story about a robot in school."
    
*   **Question for you:** Why do you think AI sometimes gives weird answers?
    

### 🔹 DALL·E (AI that creates images)

*   **Type:** "A futuristic high school classroom with AI-powered robots."
    
*   **Watch AI create a picture based on your words!**
    

### 🔹 Teachable Machine (No-code AI Training!)

*   Teachable Machine allows you to train an AI without writing a single line of code!
    
*   Train the AI to recognize your hand gestures (✋✊✌️).
    

💻 3. Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks
--------------------------------------------

### 🔹 What is a Jupyter Notebook?

Jupyter is a cool tool that lets you run Python code in the cloud—no installation needed. It’s like a digital notebook where you can write and run code at the same time.

### 🔹 Open Google Colab (It’s easy!)

Let’s get started by opening Google Colab (it’s an online Jupyter Notebook, and we don’t need to install anything).1️⃣ Click on this link to open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).2️⃣ When it opens, click **New Notebook** (this opens a fresh code page).3️⃣ Delete the first empty cell (just click on the trash can icon to delete it).

### 📌 Quick Tip:

You’re now inside your first Jupyter Notebook! Every time you write Python code here, you can see the result right away.

🐍 4. Writing Your First Python Code
------------------------------------

Python is the easiest programming language to get started with. Let's write some simple Python code!

### 🔹 Print a Message

Python can print things out for you. Let’s make it print "Hello AI!"1️⃣ In the cell, type the following code:

pythonCopy

Plain textANTLR4BashCC#CSSCoffeeScriptCMakeDartDjangoDockerEJSErlangGitGoGraphQLGroovyHTMLJavaJavaScriptJSONJSXKotlinLaTeXLessLuaMakefileMarkdownMATLABMarkupObjective-CPerlPHPPowerShell.propertiesProtocol BuffersPythonRRubySass (Sass)Sass (Scss)SchemeSQLShellSwiftSVGTSXTypeScriptWebAssemblyYAMLXML`   print("Hello AI!")   `

2️⃣ Press **Shift + Enter** to run the code!**What happened?:** You just made the computer say “Hello AI!”

### 🔹 Do Basic Math

Python can also do math! Try this:1️⃣ Type the following code:

pythonCopy

Plain textANTLR4BashCC#CSSCoffeeScriptCMakeDartDjangoDockerEJSErlangGitGoGraphQLGroovyHTMLJavaJavaScriptJSONJSXKotlinLaTeXLessLuaMakefileMarkdownMATLABMarkupObjective-CPerlPHPPowerShell.propertiesProtocol BuffersPythonRRubySass (Sass)Sass (Scss)SchemeSQLShellSwiftSVGTSXTypeScriptWebAssemblyYAMLXML`   a = 10  b = 5  sum = a + b  print("The sum is:", sum)   `

2️⃣ Press **Shift + Enter**.**What happened?:** The computer added the numbers 10 and 5 and showed you the result.

### 🔹 Ask AI a Question (Interact with the Code)

Now, let's ask Python for input!1️⃣ Type the following:

pythonCopy

Plain textANTLR4BashCC#CSSCoffeeScriptCMakeDartDjangoDockerEJSErlangGitGoGraphQLGroovyHTMLJavaJavaScriptJSONJSXKotlinLaTeXLessLuaMakefileMarkdownMATLABMarkupObjective-CPerlPHPPowerShell.propertiesProtocol BuffersPythonRRubySass (Sass)Sass (Scss)SchemeSQLShellSwiftSVGTSXTypeScriptWebAssemblyYAMLXML`   name = input("What's your name? ")  print("Nice to meet you, " + name + "!")   `

2️⃣ Press **Shift + Enter**.**What happened?:** The program will ask you your name, and then it will print a greeting with your name!

### 🚀 Challenge: Let’s Make It Personal!

*   Try changing the numbers and see what happens in the math code.
    
*   Change the message in the print() function to say something else.
    
*   Try asking different questions in the input() and make the AI respond differently.
    

🎨 5. Hands-on AI Activity (Zero-Code Fun)
------------------------------------------

Now, let’s get interactive with AI! You’ll train a model to recognize your hand gestures—no code required.

### 🔹 Train Your Own AI Model!

1️⃣ Go to [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).2️⃣ Choose **Image Project → Standard Image Model**.3️⃣ Record three hand gestures (✋✊✌️).4️⃣ Click **Train Model → Preview** to see AI recognize your gestures.

**What happened?** AI learned to recognize your hand movements!

🔥 6. Wrap-Up & Next Steps
--------------------------

Great job! You’ve just taken your first step into the world of AI. Here's what we learned:

*   AI is everywhere—from voice assistants to movie recommendations!
    
*   Jupyter Notebooks help us run Python code easily in the cloud.
    
*   We learned some Python basics: printing, math, and taking input from users.
    
*   We even trained an AI without writing code!
    

### 🚀 Next Workshop:

Next time, we will dive into data exploration—we’ll analyze real AI datasets and create colorful charts using Python.

### 📝 Homework (Optional but Fun!)

1️⃣ Explore ChatGPT: Ask it fun or silly questions!2️⃣ Try DALL·E: Generate an AI image and share it with a friend.3️⃣ Play around with the Python code: Try changing numbers and text in the code we wrote.
