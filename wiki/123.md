### **🚀 Workshop 1: Unlocking AI Magic with Jupyter (Your First Step Into the Future!)**

### **🎯 Goal**

In this session, you’ll **discover** the magic of AI! We’ll introduce you to **fun AI demos**, teach you the basics of **Python programming**, and get hands-on with **Jupyter Notebooks**—all without needing any setup or experience.

### **📌 What You Will Learn**

*   **AI and its cool uses** in your life
    
*   **Fun AI demos** (like ChatGPT and DALL·E)
    
*   The basics of **Jupyter Notebooks** (with step-by-step instructions)
    
*   **Python programming**: Print messages, do math, and interact with your code
    

### **📖 1. What is AI?**

**AI** is when machines **learn** and **think** like humans. You probably see AI all around you every day! Here are some examples:

*   **Voice assistants** like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant
    
*   **AI-generated text and art** from ChatGPT and DALL·E
    
*   **Filters** on apps like Snapchat and Instagram
    
*   **Recommendations** for movies, songs, and videos on platforms like YouTube, Netflix, and Spotify
    

🤔 **Quick Question for You**: Can you think of other places you see AI in your life? Write it down!

### **🎬 2. Fun AI Demos**

Now that we know what AI is, let’s see some **real-world examples** in action. These demos show how fun and powerful AI can be! You don’t need to write any code for these. Just watch and enjoy!

#### **🔹 ChatGPT (AI that writes text)**

*   Type: _"Write a funny story about a robot in school."_
    
*   **Question for you**: _Why do you think AI sometimes gives weird answers?_
    

#### **🔹 DALL·E (AI that creates images)**

*   Type: _"A futuristic high school classroom with AI-powered robots."_
    
*   Watch AI create a picture based on your words!
    

#### **🔹 Teachable Machine (No-code AI Training!)**

*   [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) allows you to **train an AI** without writing a single line of code!
    
*   Train the AI to recognize your **hand gestures** (✋✊✌️).
    

### **💻 3. Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks**

#### **🔹 What is a Jupyter Notebook?**

Jupyter is a **cool tool** that lets you run Python code **in the cloud**—no installation needed. It’s like a **digital notebook** where you can write and run code at the same time.

#### **🔹 Open Google Colab (It’s easy!)**

Let’s get started by opening **Google Colab** (it’s an online Jupyter Notebook, and we don’t need to install anything).1️⃣ Click on this link to open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)2️⃣ When it opens, click **New Notebook** (this opens a fresh code page).3️⃣ Delete the first empty cell (just click on the trash can icon to delete it).

📌 **Quick Tip**: You’re now inside your first Jupyter Notebook! Every time you write Python code here, you can see the result right away.

### **🐍 4. Writing Your First Python Code**

Python is the easiest programming language to get started with. Let's write some simple Python code!

#### **🔹 Print a Message**

Python can print things out for you. Let’s make it print "Hello AI!"1️⃣ In the cell, type the following code:

python

CopyEdit

print("Hello AI!")

2️⃣ Press **Shift + Enter** to run the code!**What happened?**: You just made the computer say “Hello AI!”

#### **🔹 Do Basic Math**

Python can also do math! Try this:1️⃣ Type the following code:

python

CopyEdit

a = 10

b = 5

sum = a + b

print("The sum is:", sum)

2️⃣ Press **Shift + Enter**.**What happened?**: The computer added the numbers 10 and 5 and showed you the result.

#### **🔹 Ask AI a Question (Interact with the Code)**

Now, let's ask Python for input!1️⃣ Type the following:

python

CopyEdit

name = input("What's your name? ")

print("Nice to meet you, " + name + "!")

2️⃣ Press **Shift + Enter**.**What happened?**: The program will ask you your name, and then it will print a greeting with your name!

### **🚀 Challenge: Let’s Make It Personal!**

**Challenge for you**:

*   Try changing the numbers and see what happens in the math code.
    
*   Change the message in the print() function to say something else.
    
*   Try asking different questions in the input() and make the AI respond differently.
    

### **🎨 5. Hands-on AI Activity (Zero-Code Fun)**

Now, let’s get interactive with AI! You’ll train a model to recognize **your hand gestures**—no code required.

#### **🔹 Train Your Own AI Model!**

1️⃣ Go to [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).2️⃣ Choose **Image Project** → **Standard Image Model**.3️⃣ Record three hand gestures (✋✊✌️).4️⃣ Click **Train Model** → **Preview** to see AI recognize your gestures.

What happened? AI **learned** to recognize your hand movements!

### **🔥 6. Wrap-Up & Next Steps**

Great job! You’ve just taken your first step into the world of AI. Here's what we learned:

*   **AI is everywhere**—from voice assistants to movie recommendations!
    
*   **Jupyter Notebooks** help us run Python code easily in the cloud.
    
*   We learned some Python basics: **printing**, **math**, and **taking input** from users.
    
*   We even **trained an AI** without writing code!
    

#### **🚀 Next Workshop:**

Next time, we will dive into **data exploration**—we’ll analyze real AI datasets and create colorful charts using Python.

### **📝 Homework (Optional but Fun!)**

1️⃣ Explore **ChatGPT**: Ask it fun or silly questions!2️⃣ Try **DALL·E**: Generate an AI image and share it with a friend.3️⃣ Play around with the Python code: Try changing numbers and text in the code we wrote.
