# 📖 **1. What is AI?** 🤔
### **AI = Machines that Think!** 💡
AI is when computers learn and make decisions like humans. You already use AI every day!

🗣️ **Voice assistants** like **Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant**  
🎭 **AI-generated art & text** from **<a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>** & **<a href="https://openai.com/dall-e" target="_blank">DALL·E</a>**  
📸 **Photo filters** on Snapchat & Instagram  
🎥 **Movie & music recommendations** on Netflix, YouTube, & Spotify  

💡 **Quick Thought:** Where else do you see AI? Jot down your ideas! 📝

# 🎬 **2. Fun AI Demos** 🎮
### **🤖 ChatGPT (AI that Writes)** 📝💡
**Try this:** "Write a funny story about a robot in school."  
🔗 <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>

### **🎨 DALL·E (AI that Creates Art)** 🖼️
**Try this:** "A futuristic high school classroom with AI-powered robots."  
🔗 <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e" target="_blank">DALL·E</a>

### **🎓 Teachable Machine (Train an AI!)** 🤖

# 💻 **3. Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks** 🖥️
### **What is a Jupyter Notebook?** 📒
A Jupyter Notebook is like a **smart digital notebook** where you can write and run Python code **in small sections (cells).** Think of it as typing notes and instantly running experiments on a computer! 📝💡

🔹 **Jupyter = Digital Lab Notebook for AI & Coding!** 🚀

### **🚀 Open Google Colab (Easiest Way!)**
1️⃣ Click **<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Colab</a>**  
2️⃣ Click **New Notebook**  
3️⃣ 🎉 You’re ready to code!

💡 **Why Google Colab?** No installation required! Just open the link and start coding. 🚀

# 🐍 **4. Your First Python Code (Step-by-Step)** 🚀
### **🔹 Print a Message** 📢
👉 **Step 1:** Click inside a code cell (A gray box labeled 'Code')  
👉 **Step 2:** Copy and paste the following code:  
```python
print("Hello AI World!")
```
👉 **Step 3:** Press the **Play Icon** to run it! 🎉  
✅ If done correctly, you should see: `Hello AI World!` printed below the cell.

### **🔹 Do Basic Math** ➕➖
👉 **Step 1:** Click inside a new code cell  
👉 **Step 2:** Copy and paste the following code:  
```python
a = 10
b = 5
sum = a + b
print("The sum is:", sum)
```
👉 **Step 3:** Press the **Play Icon** to run it!  
🧐 **What’s happening?** The computer adds `10 + 5` and prints the result! 🔢

### **🔹 AI-Powered Interaction** 🤖
👉 **Step 1:** Click inside a new code cell  
👉 **Step 2:** Copy and paste the following code:  
```python
name = input("What’s your name? ")
print("Nice to meet you, " + name + "!")
```
👉 **Step 3:** Press the **Play Icon** to run it, then type your name in the box that appears and hit **Enter**  
✅ AI will greet you with: `Nice to meet you, [Your Name]!`

🎯 **Challenge:** Modify the message or numbers and rerun!

💡 **Extra Tip:** Google Colab allows you to run one code block at a time. If something goes wrong, just re-run the block!
