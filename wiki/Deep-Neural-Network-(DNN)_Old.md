## 🧠 **What is a Deep Neural Network (DNN)?**  
A **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** is a type of **machine learning model** designed to recognize patterns. It is made up of layers of **neurons**, which are simple mathematical functions that process data. Each **neuron** receives an input, processes it, and passes the result to the next neuron in the network.

Here are some key terms to understand before we dive into the code:

- **Neuron**: A mathematical function that takes an input, applies a transformation (like multiplying by a weight), and sends an output.
- **Layer**: A collection of neurons working together. A DNN typically has multiple layers:
  - **Input Layer**: The first layer that takes in raw data (like an image or a number).
  - **Hidden Layers**: Layers in between the input and output layers that learn complex patterns in the data.
  - **Output Layer**: The final layer that gives the predicted result (like a classification or numerical output).
- **Activation Function**: A mathematical operation that helps the network learn non-linear patterns. A common function is **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**.

## 🖼️ **Visualizing a Simple DNN**  
Below is a simple diagram of a Deep Neural Network to help visualize its structure:

```
+------------------+
|     Input        |  <-- Input layer (Your data goes here)
|     (Features)   |
+------------------+
        |
        V
+------------------+
| Hidden Layer 1   |  <-- Hidden layers (Where the model learns)
+------------------+
        |
        V
+------------------+
| Hidden Layer 2   |  <-- More hidden layers (Extracts more complex patterns)
+------------------+
        |
        V
+------------------+
|     Output       |  <-- Output layer (Final prediction result)
+------------------+
```

- **Input Layer**: This is where you put your raw data, like a list of numbers or images.
- **Hidden Layers**: These layers process the data and learn complex patterns.
- **Output Layer**: This layer produces the final result or prediction.

## 💻 **Step-by-Step Tutorial: Building Your First DNN**

### 🚀 **Step 1: Open Google Colab**  
1. Go to **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)**.
2. Click on **+ New Notebook** to create a new notebook.

---

### 📦 **Step 2: Install and Import Libraries**  
First, let’s import the libraries we need. We will use **TensorFlow** for building the DNN and **NumPy** for handling data.

```python
import tensorflow as tf  # For building deep neural networks
from tensorflow import keras  # For simplifying the model creation
import numpy as np  # For numerical operations and data handling
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # For visualizing training progress
```

Click **Run** to load the libraries.

---

### 📊 **Step 3: Prepare the Data**  
For simplicity, we’ll create some basic data where the output is simply **double the input**. The DNN will learn this relationship.

```python
# Create simple data (X) and corresponding output (y)
X = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], dtype=float)  # Input data
y = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20], dtype=float)  # Output data
```

Click **Run** to create the data.

---

### 🛠️ **Step 4: Build the DNN Model**  
Now, let’s build our neural network using **Keras**. The model will have two layers:
1. A **hidden layer** with 10 neurons, using the **ReLU** activation function.
2. An **output layer** with 1 neuron (since we’re predicting a single number).

```python
# Create a simple neural network model with two layers
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),  # Hidden layer with 10 neurons and ReLU activation
    keras.layers.Dense(1)  # Output layer with 1 neuron
])

# Compile the model with an optimizer and a loss function
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mse')  # 'sgd' is the method for updating the model's learning
```

Click **Run** to build the model.

---

### 🎓 **Step 5: Train the Model**  
Next, we’ll train the model on our data. Training means the model will learn the patterns in the data over several **epochs** (iterations).

```python
# Train the model for 100 epochs (iterations)
history = model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, verbose=0)  # The model will learn over 100 iterations
```

Click **Run** to start training.

---

### 📈 **Step 6: Visualize Training Progress**  
Let’s visualize how well the model is learning by plotting the **loss function**. The loss shows how much error is left in the model’s predictions.

```python
# Create a graph showing the loss (error) during training
plt.plot(history.history['loss'])
plt.xlabel('Epochs')  # X-axis shows the number of iterations
plt.ylabel('Loss')  # Y-axis shows how much error remains
plt.title('Training Progress')
plt.show()  # Display the graph
```

Click **Run** to see the graph.

---

### 🔮 **Step 7: Make Predictions**  
Now that the model is trained, let’s see how well it predicts. We’ll give it an input of **11** and see if it predicts **22** (since the relationship is simply **output = input * 2**).

```python
# Ask the model to predict the output for input 11
prediction = model.predict([11])
print("Predicted Output for Input 11:", prediction[0][0])
```

Click **Run** to get the prediction. The model should predict **22**.
