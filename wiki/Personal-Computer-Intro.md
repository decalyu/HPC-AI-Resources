## 📚 **1. Understanding AI** 🤔

### **What is AI?** 🤖 
**AI = Machines that Think! 💡**  
AI is when computers learn and make decisions like humans. You already use AI every day! 

- 🎙️ **Voice Assistants** (e.g., Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant for hands-free help)    
- 🎭 **AI-Generated Art & Text** (e.g., chatbots and social media content creation)     
- 📸 **Photo Filters** (e.g., fun effects on Snapchat and Instagram)    
- 🎥 **Movie & Music Recommendations** (e.g., personalized suggestions on Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify)     

💡 **Quick Thought:** Where else do you see AI? Jot down your ideas!🤔💭

## 🖥️ **3. Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks**
### **What is a Jupyter Notebook? 📒**  
A Jupyter Notebook is like a smart digital notebook where you can write and run Python code in small sections (cells). Think of it as typing notes and instantly running experiments on a computer! 📝💡  

🔹 **Jupyter = Digital Lab Notebook for AI & Coding!** 🚀

### 🚀 **Step 1: Open Google Colab**
1️⃣ Open your browser and go to  **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)**.  
2️⃣ Click **+ New notebook**.

```python
# Assigning the value 10 to variable 'a'
a = 10

# Assigning the value 5 to variable 'b'
b = 5

# Calculating the sum of 'a' and 'b' and storing it in the variable 'sum'
sum = a + b

# Printing the result of the sum to the screen
print("The sum is:", sum)  
```
🔗[**ChatGPT explanation for the code**](https://chatgpt.com/share/67d1089c-6ebc-800e-ad20-492feda68d7f)
