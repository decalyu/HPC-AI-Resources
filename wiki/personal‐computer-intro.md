# 📌 Intro to Command Terminal, AI, Docker & Jupyter

Welcome to the first step of your AI and High-Performance Computing (HPC) journey! In this section, we’ll introduce you to the essential tools and concepts you’ll need to get started. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a solid foundation in using the **command terminal**, understanding **AI basics**, working with **Docker**, and running code in **Jupyter Notebooks**.

## 🖥️ What You’ll Learn
- **Command Terminal**: The gateway to interacting with your computer like a pro.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: What it is, why it matters, and how it’s changing the world.
- **Docker**: A tool that simplifies software setup so you can focus on learning.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: An interactive environment for writing and running code.

---

## 🚀 Why These Tools?
- **Command Terminal**: It’s the backbone of working with computers, especially for AI and HPC.
- **AI**: From self-driving cars to chatbots, AI is everywhere—and you’ll learn how it works.
- **Docker**: No more “it works on my machine” problems! Docker ensures everyone has the same setup.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Perfect for experimenting with code and visualizing results.

## 🎯 Hands-On Activity
Let’s get started with a quick exercise:
1. Open your command terminal.
2. Run the following command to launch a pre-built Docker environment:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8888:8888 your-docker-image
